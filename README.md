# University-Cyber-Attack-Project
<b>University Cyber Attack Incident Response and Analysis</b>

<b>Project Description:</b>
<p>As a Cyber Security Officer and member of the Incident Response Team, I led the investigation and response efforts following a cyber attack targeting our university's network. The incident, reported by teaching staff member Samantha R. Collen, involved abusive and threatening messages received via email, alongside suspected unauthorized access during the term examination.</p>

<b>Key Responsibilities and Achievements:</b>

<p><p>Conducted comprehensive network scans using Kali Linux to identify vulnerabilities and potential points of entry, adhering to industry-standard best practices for cyber threat analysis.</p>
<p>Utilized National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and other open-source datasets to assess the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) scores associated with identified vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Implemented simulated attacks, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks, to analyze their impact on the university's network and identify potential security gaps</p>
<p>Employed email forensics analysis techniques to trace the sender's IP address, enabling the identification of malicious actors and enhancing attribution capabilities.</p>
<p>Prepared and submitted a comprehensive incident report detailing findings, analysis, and recommendations for mitigating future cyber threats, demonstrating effective communication and documentation skills.</p></p>
